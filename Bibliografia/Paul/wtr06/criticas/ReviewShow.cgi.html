paper proposes a dual mechanism based in a TDMA and a virtual token
passing to handle hard real-time and soft real-time messages in shared
Ethernet. The protocol uses a sequence of Windows alternatively
reserved for the hard and the soft messages. The hard messages window
includes a reserved part that can be reclaimed on-line by the nodes.<br>The
paper is well written and reasonably organized. The subject is relevant
for the workshop. Although there are claims that shared Ethernet is
outdated, I still consider the subject promising but it is the
obligation of the authors to sustain the interest of the work.-<br>The
proposed protocol tries to isolate hard from soft traffics by using
different windows, claiming that they have different requirements,
which is true. However the paper has several problems, namely:<br>a)	The description of the protocol is not sufficiently clear and the notation used is hard to understand.<br>b)	The paper uses some wrong assumptions from related work.<br>c)	The paper does not evaluate the impact of the protocol on the parameter specification of traffic flows.<br>d)	The paper doesnt present (numerical) results.<br>Considering
a), it is not clear in the paper how messages are scheduled in the
windows, particularly in Wh. It seems that more than one message can be
transmitted in each window but, from the last part of the paper, it
seems that 2 is the proposed number. Before explaining clearly the
protocol, the authors enter immediately in implementation details,
which difficult the understanding. Using pi and delta and other odd
variable notations adds further difficulty. The IFG tolerance in the
timers seems also excessive and will certainly lead to significant
variation in the window length.<br>Assumptions made about Carreiros
work are wrong. The referred 111usec are specific of the hardware used
(time to decode a frame) and are not characteristic of automation
systems.<br>Interleaving soft and presumably long messages with hard
real-time ones will certainly lead to a very large token rotation time
(not deduced in the paper). This will limit strongly the minimum period
of hard messages and it may make the protocol unsuitable for industrial
applications.<br>To avoid the previous impressions a numerical example would be mandatory. <br>Additionally there are several points in the paper that deserve improvement:<br>The
state of the art is rather short. Although not for Ethernet, other dual
ring schemes should be referred even if they show some differences,
e.g. the proposeb by Lo Bello for Profibus.<br>The reservation
mechanism for Wr is not properly described. The interest for the
envisaged applications is not evident (and is not discussed).<br>Fault-tolerance issues are also scratched but in a confusing way. <br>The
synchronization of the Ws window seems difficult as it will be used by
systems with OS which make not easy to guarantee the timeliness in the
access. So, how to implement the protocol in such systems is not
evident.</dd></dl></td></tr><tr align="center" bgcolor="#66ff66"><td><b>review</b></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2006-03-17 19:24:36</td><td>2006-03-17 19:24:36</td><td>2006-03-20 08:52:19</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2006-03-23</td><td>2006-03-27 08:22:48</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><table><tbody><tr><td><i><small><b>Originality and Contribution:</b>: .</small></i></td><td><i><small><b>Technical strenght:</b>: .</small></i></td><td><i><small><b>Paper organization and presentation:</b>: .</small></i></td><td><i><small><b>Recommendation for this paper:</b>: .</small></i></td></tr><tr><td>2: Fair - Minor contribution</td><td>2: Fair </td><td>3: Average</td><td>2: Weak Reject - I will not fight strongly against it</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td colspan="8"><dl><dt><i><b>What are the major strengths of this paper?</b>: What are the major strengths of this paper?</i></dt><dd class="review">The

is not deterministic. Consequently, to be used in hard real-time
applications some modifications have to be made. These, however, must
not require hardware alterations in order to use standard commercial
devices. The two main lines open are: 1) To manage the system in a
master-slave mode. 2) To use an implicit (virtual, by silence) token
passing in a real bus/virtual ring topology. Although the first one is
as reliable as the original CSMA/CD, the authors discard it on the
grounds of problems of scalability and performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;They
should explain the rejection better.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The authors adhere
instead to the second line. The required strict synchronization is its
main implementation problem. However, the authors just skip
it&nbsp;&nbsp;by arguing a sort of Fermat´ s lack of space. <br>Since
available commercial Ethernet devices are relatively inexpensive, some
consideration should be given to the cost of actually assembling two
real LANs to&nbsp;&nbsp;cope separately with hard and soft messages
vis-a-vis the reliability of the whole system. The soft network would
be pure CSMA. The two possible models should be exhaustively explored
for the hard one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> As it is at present, the paper is at most a candidate for the WiP session.</dd></dl></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td colspan="8"><dl><dt><i><b>Other comments to authors:</b>: Other comments to authors:</i></dt><dd class="review">You
have traversed less than half way to a mature paper. To devise a
protocol that does not modify but it is added to the CSMA/CD standard
is relatively easy. Installing it and making it work is the difficult
part. The main problems will be in the synchronization aspects. Also,
having in mind that releases and deadlines of real-time tasks are in
the applications over the communications protocol, travel time through
the protocol layers in both directions (including the substantial
addition over the MAC sublayer) would probably be a non negligible
overhead. The paper would be publishable only after experimental (not
simulated) testing.</dd></dl></td></tr><tr align="center" bgcolor="#66ff66"><td><b>review</b></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2006-03-31 16:40:18</td><td>2006-03-31 16:40:18</td><td>2006-04-03 05:55:13</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2006-03-23</td><td>2006-04-03 05:57:02</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><table><tbody><tr><td><i><small><b>Originality and Contribution:</b>: .</small></i></td><td><i><small><b>Technical strenght:</b>: .</small></i></td><td><i><small><b>Paper organization and presentation:</b>: .</small></i></td><td><i><small><b>Recommendation for this paper:</b>: .</small></i></td></tr><tr><td>3: Average - Small but clear contribution</td><td>2: Fair </td><td>3: Average</td><td>3: Weak Accept - I will not fight strongly in favour of acceptance</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td colspan="8"><dl><dt><i><b>What are the major strengths of this paper?</b>: What are the major strengths of this paper?</i></dt><dd class="review">A small and well defined problem. **********************</dd></dl></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#eeeeee"><td colspan="8"><dl><dt><i><b>What are the major weakness of this paper?</b>: What are the major weakness of this paper?</i></dt><dd class="review">The

thing I was missing was the discussion of overhead caused by receiving
no RT messages, which had to be decoded due to being broadcast to all
nodes.<br><br>A major drawback of your approach is that in the worst
case scenario one node has to wait for 2 rounds before being able to
transmit (the first round until it can put out a reservation message,
