***********************************************************
*
* To finish the installation you have to move the following
* files into a directory searched by TeX:
*
* All the files with extension `.sty' and `.tex'
* Note there also may be a file .tex which is `invisible'
* on some operating systems.
*
* To produce the documentation run the .dtx files through LaTeX.
*
* Happy TeXing
***********************************************************

* Finally trying to make a file `.tex'.
* (Placed at the end of this run, as this
* may fail on some operating systems.)
