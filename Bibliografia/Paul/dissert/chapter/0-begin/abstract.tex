  This work presents a protocol that makes shared-Ethernet suitable for supporting
  modern real-time systems. The protocol has been formally specified and its temporal properties
  were verified using a model-checker.  A prototype of the proposed protocol has been implemented 
  in a real-time operational system. Experimental results show the capacity of the protocol
  to achieve the goals defined for its proposal. 

  Applications that can benefit from the proposed protocol are mainly those composed
  of heterogeneous distributed components, which are specified in terms of both hard
  and soft timing constraints.
    
  Using the proposed protocol, such systems can efficiently and
  predictably use an Ethernet bus.  The bus utilization is optimized
  by an appropriate allocation of the available bandwidth into hard
  and soft communication.  Moreover, the protocol, compatible with
  standard Ethernet hardware, implements a decentralized medium access
  control that provides communication flexibility and reliability.
