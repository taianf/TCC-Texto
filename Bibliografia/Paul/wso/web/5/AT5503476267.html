continues his real-time series by examining efforts to bring real-time
capabilities to applications by improving the Linux kernel.</i><br><br>In the January/February 2002 issue of <i>Embedded Linux Journal</i>,
we examined the fundamental issues of real time with Linux. In this
article we examine efforts to bring real-time capabilities to
applications by making improvements to the Linux kernel. To date, the
majority of this work has been to make the kernel more responsive--to
reduce latency by reducing the preemption latency, which can be quite
long in Linux.<br><br>By improving the kernel, and not changing or
adding to the API, applications can run more responsively by merely
switching out a standard kernel for the improved one. This is a big
benefit. It means that ISVs need not create special versions for
different real-time efforts. For example, DVD players may run more
reliably on an improved kernel without needing to be aware that the
kernel they are running on has been improved.<br><br><b>Background and History</b><br><br>With
around Linux kernel release 2.2, the issue of kernel preemptibility
began to get quite a lot of attention. Paul Barton-Davis and Benno
Senoner, for example, wrote a <a href="http://lists.insecure.org/linux-kernel/2000/Jul/0123.html" target="_blank"><u>letter</u></a>
(which in addition was signed by many others) to Linus Torvalds, asking
that 2.4 please include significantly reduced preemption delays.<br><br>Their
request was based on their desire to have Linux function well with
audio, music and MIDI. Senoner produced some benchmarking software that
demonstrated that the 2.2 kernel (and later the 2.4 kernel) had
worst-case preemption latencies on the order of 100ms (<a href="http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/audio/" target="_blank"><u>reference</u></a>).
Latencies of this magnitude are unacceptable for audio applications.
Conventional wisdom seems to say that latencies on the order of no more
than a few milliseconds are required.<br><br>Two efforts emerged that
produced patched kernels that provided quite reasonable preemption
latencies. Ingo Molnar (of Red Hat) and Andrew Morton (then of The
University of Wollongong) both produced patch sets that provided
preemption within particularly long sections in the kernel. You can
find Ingo Molnar's patches <a href="http://people.redhat.com/mingo/lowlatency-patches/" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>, and you can find Andrew Morton's work <a href="http://www.zipworld.com.au/%7Eakpm/linux/schedlat.html" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.<br><br>In
addition, Morton provides tools for measuring latencies, such as
periods where the kernel ignores reschedule requests. His low-latency
patches' web page, cited above, provides information on those as well.<br><br>Recently,
at least two organizations have produced preemptible kernels that
provide a more fundamental, and powerful, solution to the kernel
preemptibility problem.<br><br>In the <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT5997007602.html" target="_blank"><u>first article of this series</u></a> in the January/February 2002 issue of <i>ELJ</i>,
we listed several other desired features for real-time support in
Linux, including increased number of priority levels, user-space
interrupt handling and DMA, priority inheritance on synchronization
mechanisms, microsecond time resolution, complete POSIX 1003.1b
functionality and a constant time algorithm for scheduling. We will
briefly comment on these as well.<br><br>A key point to remember with
all of these improvements is that they involve patching the kernel.
Anytime you patch a kernel you must assume that you no longer have
binary compatibility for other kernel code, such as drivers. For
example, the preemptible kernel approaches require modifying the code
for spin locks. A binary driver won't employ this modification and thus
may not prevent preemption properly. This emphasizes the need to have
the source and recompile all kernel code. The Linux model for drivers
is one of source-compatibility anyway. Distribution of binary-only
drivers is discouraged for compatibility as well as for open-source
philosophy reasons.<br><br><b>Improvements</b><br><br>Various efforts
that improve the kernel provide essentially transparent benefits. The
efforts to improve the preemptibility of the kernel, be they through a
preemptible kernel or through preemption points, result in a kernel
that is more responsive to applications without any alterations in
these applications.<br><br>Another aspect of transparency is whether
the changes are transparent to the kernel, or in other words, do the
approaches automatically track with changes in the kernel. The
preemption point approaches of Molnar and Morton require that the
scheduling latencies in new kernels be measured and preemption points
placed in the proper places.<br><br>In contrast, the approaches to
creating a preemptible kernel piggyback on the SMP locking and thus
automatically transfer with new kernel versions. Also, by tying the
preemptibility to the SMP-locking mechanism, as kernel developers
improve the granularity of the SMP locking, the granularity of the
preemption will improve automatically as well. We are likely to see
steady improvement in SMP-locking granularity because improvement in
this is required for improved SMP scaling.<br><br>It is because of this
co-opting of the SMP locks that the preemptible kernel work depends
upon a 2.4 or newer kernel. Prior kernels lacked the required SMP locks.<br><br>Another
important benefit of the preemptible kernel approach to emphasize is
that the approach makes code, which is otherwise unaware of it,
preemptible. For example, driver writers need do nothing special to
have their driver preemptible. Code in the driver will be preempted as
required unless the driver holds a lock. Thus, as in other parts of the
kernel, well-written drivers that are SMP-safe automatically will
benefit from a preemptible kernel. On the other hand, drivers that are
not SMP-safe may not function correctly with the preemptible kernels.<br><br>One
should be aware, though, that just because one's driver does not
request a lock, kernel code calling it may. For example, we found in a
simple test with MontaVista's preemptible kernel that the functions
read() and write() of a dynamically loaded driver were preempted just
fine, while the functions init_module(), open() and close() were not.
This means that if a low-priority process does an open() or close(), it
may delay its preemption by a newly awoken high-priority process.<br><br>In
practice, developers still should measure the latencies they are
seeing. With the preemptible kernel approaches we see that it is still
possible that a section of kernel code can hold a lock for a period
longer than acceptable for one's application.<br><br>MontaVista, for
example, provides a preemptible kernel, adds a few preemption points in
sections where locks are held too long and provides measurement tools
so that developers can measure the preemptibility performance with
their actual applications and environment.<br><br>The goal of SMP locks
is to ensure safe re-entrance into the kernel. That is, if processes
running in parallel require kernel resources, access to these resources
is done safely. The smaller the granularity of the locking, the greater
the chance that competing processes can continue to execute in
parallel. Parallelization is improved as the blocking (because of
contention) is reduced.<br><br>This concept applies to uniprocessors as
well, when I/O is considered. If one considers I/O devices as separate
processors, then parallelization, or throughput, improves as
applications and I/O activities can continue in parallel. Improvements
in preemptibility, which imply that high-priority I/O-bound processes
wake up more quickly, can thus improve throughput. Thus, somewhat
paradoxically, we see that even though we may experience more context
swaps and execute more code in critical kernel paths, we may still see
greater system throughput.<br><br>The benefits of a preemptible kernel
seem to be so clear that we can expect preemptibility eventually to be
a standard feature of the Linux kernel. Preemptible kernels have been
shown to reduce latencies to just a few milliseconds for some
implementations and to as low as tens of microseconds in others.<br><br>In
a quick survey of embedded Linux vendors, MontaVista and TimeSys
provide preemptible kernels, REDSonic has preemption points, LynuxWorks
and Red Hat use RTLinux. Lineo uses RTAI. OnCore provides Linux
preemptibility both through a Linux system call-compatible API (as does
LynuxWorks with LynxOS) and through running a Linux kernel (which
effectively becomes preemptible) on top of their preemptible
microkernel.<br><br><b>Preemption Points</b><br><br>Preemption points
are essentially calls to the scheduler to check to see if a
higher-priority task is ready and should be run. Molnar and Morton
timed paths in the kernel and found sections that were quite long and
inserted the schedule check calls. You can readily find these places by
examining the patches, or by applying the patches and comparing the
before-and-after versions of the affected source files. Preemption
patches look like <tt>if (current -&gt;need_resched) schedule();</tt>.<br><br>To
use Andrew Morton's preemption point kernel patch, download the patch
from the URL above and download the appropriate Linux kernel version
from <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/" target="_blank"><u>kernel.org</u></a>. Apply the patch and rebuild the kernel as usual. More details can be found <a href="http://www.linuxdj.com/audio/lad/contrib/2.4-install-notes.html" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>, although the notes are for an old 2.4 kernel. Also, take note that you may need to update your development environment.<br><br>To
use Molnar's patches you do the same thing. Download the patch and
create a new kernel. Morton has patches for many 2.4 kernels. Molnar
has patches for some 2.2 kernels and some early 2.4 kernels.<br><br><b>Preemptible Kernels</b><br><br>Preemptible
kernels provide for one user process to be preempted in the midst of a
system call so that a newly awoken higher-priority process can run.
This preemption cannot be done safely at arbitrary places in the kernel
code. One section of code where this may not be safe is within a
critical section. A critical section is a code sequence that must not
be executed by more than one process at the same time. In the Linux
kernel these sections are protected by spin locks.<br><br>MontaVista
and TimeSys have taken similar approaches to creating a preemptible
kernel. They cleverly alter the spin-lock calls to additionally prevent
preemption. In this way, preemption is permitted in other sections.
When a higher-priority process awakens, the scheduler will preempt a
lower-priority process in a system call if the system call code has not
indicated, via the modified spin-lock code, that preemption is not
possible.<br><br>In addition, with a preemptible kernel, breaking locks
to allow rescheduling is simpler than with the preemption (low-latency)
patches. If the kernel releases a lock and then re-acquires it, when
the lock is released preemption will be checked for. There are places
in the kernel where a lock is held, say in a loop, where it need not be
held the entire time. Perhaps for each iteration it can be released and
then re-acquired.<br><br>MontaVista implements preemption through a
counter. When a spin lock is acquired, the counter is incremented. When
a high-priority process awakens, the scheduler checks to see whether
the preemption counter indicates, by having the value zero, that
preemption is allowed. By employing a counter, the mechanism works when
locks are nested. With this mechanism, however, any spin-lock-held
critical section prevents preemption, even if the lock is for an
unrelated resource.<br><br>TimeSys employs a priority inheritance
mutex. With this mechanism, a high-priority process can preempt a
low-priority process that holds a mutex for a different resource. In
addition, since they employ priority inheritance, low-priority
processes holding a mutex cannot indefinitely postpone a
higher-priority process waiting on the mutex. This solves the so-called
Priority Inversion Problem.<br><br>One can obtain the preemption patches developed by MontaVista from the SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/kpreempt/" target="_blank"><u>kpreempt website</u></a>.
MontaVista is conducting this work in a laudable, open-source manner.
They also provide their work on a real-time scheduler and
high-resolution timers on SourceForge, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rtsched/" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/high-res-timers/" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.<br><br>The
SourceForge kpreempt Project also gives a link to Robert Love's
preemptible kernel work [see the April and May 2002 issues of <i>Linux Journal</i>
for more information on Love's kernel work]. These are MontaVista's
patches and are now maintained by Love, although MontaVista is still
involved. The newest patches are available <a href="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/preempt-kernel/" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.<br><br>A
recent release of Love's work was created to work with a recent
constant time scheduler patch by Ingo Molnar. Molnar's O(1) scheduler
is available as a patch for 2.4 and has been merged into 2.5. TimeSys
makes their preemptible kernel available on their <a href="http://www.timesys.com/" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a>.
The preemptible kernel is provided already patched. To obtain the
patches, you need to back them out with diff from a 2.4.7 kernel source
tree. Their preemptible kernel source is released under the GPL.<br><br>TimeSys
additionally has a number of other valuable capabilities for real-time
developers that are not available for free download. These include
technology for real-time scheduling and resource allocation. These
modules add additional system calls, for example, to provide for
conventional access to their enhancements.<br><br>For those interested
in examining the gory details we provide a couple of hints on where to
look. The key to the spin-lock mechanism is the include file,
spinlock.h, under include/linux. Both MontaVista and TimeSys modify
this file.<br><br>Interestingly, both seem to rename, and continue to
use, the old functions. The original spin-lock functions still are
required. It is not acceptable, for example, to preempt the kernel
while it is in the scheduler. Infinite recursion would ensue.
MontaVista uses names like _raw_spin_lock and _raw_read_lock; TimeSys
uses names like old_spin_lock and old_spin_lock_irq.<br><br>By
examining the file kernel/include/linux/mutex.h in the TimeSys
distribution you can see that spin locks have been defined to use
write_lock() and read_lock() functions that implement mutex locks. The
file kernel/kernel/mutex.c includes the source to the do_write_lock()
function, for example, which implements the mutex locking functionality.<br><br><b>Other Real-Time Kernel Efforts</b><br><br>Another
popular area for improvement is in the granularity of timing. TimeSys,
MontaVista, REDSonic and others have solutions that greatly improve
time resolution. For example, TimeSys queries the Pentium Time Stamp
Counter on context switches to insure quite accurate CPU time
accounting for use of such functions as getrusage().<br><br>In the
opinion of many developers, including this author, Linux's lack of the
complete set of POSIX 1003.1b functionality is a significant
shortcoming. Luckily, there are solutions. In particular, TimeSys has
quite a good implementation.<br><br>In addition to their POSIX
contributions, TimeSys has developed some innovative resource control
mechanisms. These allow a real-time application to reserve CPU time or
network bandwidth, for example. This, coupled with their interrupt
threading model, preemptible kernel and other features, provide two or
three orders of magnitude of improvement in terms of latency over a
standard Linux kernel.<br><br>To date, it appears that little has been
done to allow a user-space application to register a function to be
called as an interrupt handler. This mechanism is called user-space
interrupt handling and is available, for example, in IRIX, SGI's UNIX.<br><br>Interestingly,
SGI, in Linux, provides user-space access to the interrupts from a
real-time clock in their ds1286 real-time clock interface. This can be
obtained <a href="http://www.linuxhq.com/kernel/v2.4/patch/patch-2.4.10-pre1/linux/drivers/sgi/char/ds1286.c.html" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.<br><br>Related to user-level interrupt handling is user-space DMA to and from devices. There is a patch to provide that functionality, <a href="http://linux-patches.rock-projects.com/v2.2-f/userdma-2.2.5.html" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.<br><br><b>Guarantees</b><br><br>Apparently,
no real-time Linux vendor is willing to make a guarantee for latency. A
guarantee, if given, may have the form of something like<br><br></font><blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3">
With our Linux kernel, and these hardware requirements, and these
drivers, etc., we guarantee that your application, if it is locked in
memory, has the highest priority...and will be awoken within <i>N</i>
microseconds after your real-time device raises a hardware interrupt.
If you are not able to achieve the guarantee, then we will treat it as
a bug.<br><br></font></blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3"> Since we see no such guarantees, what can we infer? We can think of several possibilities.<br><br>Vendors
do not see any benefit in making the guarantee. No customers request
it. In our opinion, many developers want a guarantee. In fact, hard
real time implies a guarantee.<br><br>Vendors have not sufficiently
measured their kernels and environment to be able to give a guarantee.
This is a bit tricky. Measuring alone can't prove a guarantee can be
satisfied. One must determine that the code is bounded in every
circumstance and that all worst-case paths are measured. From the
vendors' announcements, it is apparent that many of them have spent
quite a lot of effort both measuring and studying the code. In fact, it
is likely that many engineers feel rather confident that they could
guarantee a certain number given the right environment.<br><br>Linux is
too diverse to allow for any meaningful guarantees. This is likely the
heart of the issue. Developers want to be able to modify their kernel.
They want to be able to download drivers and use them. Activities such
as these are beyond the control of a vendor. If a vendor were to claim
a guarantee publicly, it may have to be for a system so constrained as
to be useful for only one or a few select situations.<br><br>Perhaps
we'll see some kind of compromise guarantee, something like "100ms or
less on Pentium class computers for properly behaving applications"
plus the time spent in drivers. The driver caveat is important, for
example, because the interrupt handling code is probably in the driver
and thus a major part of the latency path.<br><br><b>What's Next?</b><br><br>In
the third article of our series we will discuss real-time functionality
available through means outside of a Linux kernel. We will consider
approaches such as RTLinux and RTAI. We also will return to
benchmarking and comparing the wide variety of options.<br><br></font><hr><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3"><br></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3"><img src="AT5503476267_files/5742aa.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5"></font></p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3"><i><b>About the author:</b>
