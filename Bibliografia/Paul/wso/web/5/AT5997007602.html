is real time? This article, first of a three-part series, introduces
the benchmarks we'll run on real-time Linux version in the next two
issues.</i><br><br>Linux is well tuned for throughput-limited
applications, but it is not well designed for deterministic response,
though enhancements to the kernel are available to help or guarantee
determinism. So-called real-time applications require, among other
things, deterministic response. In this article I examine the nature of
real-time applications and Linux's strengths and weaknesses in
supporting such applications. In later articles I will examine various
approaches to help real-time applications satisfy hard real-time
requirements. Most of these issues are with respect to the Linux
kernel, but the GNU C library, for example, plays a part in some of
this.<br><br><b>What Is Real Time?</b><br><br>Many definitions are
available for the terms relating to real time. In fact, because they
have different requirements, different applications demand different
definitions. Some applications may be satisfied by some average
response time while others may require that every deadline be met.<br><br>The
response time of an application is that time interval from when it
receives a stimulus, usually provided via a hardware interrupt, to when
the application has produced a result based on that stimulus. These
results may be such things as the opening of a valve in an industrial
control application, drawing a frame of graphics in a visual simulation
or processing a packet of data in a data-acquisition application.<br><br>Let's
consider an opening of a valve scenario. Imagine we have a sensor next
to a conveyor belt with parts that need to be painted that move past a
paint nozzle. When the part is just in the right position the sensor
alerts our system that the valve on the paint nozzle should open to
allow paint to be sprayed onto the part. Do we need to have this valve
open at just the right time on average, or every time? Every time would
be nice.<br><br>We need to open the valve no later than the latest time
that it's not too late to begin painting the part. We also need to
close the valve no sooner than when we are finished with painting the
part. Thus, it is desirable to not keep the valve open any longer than
necessary, since we really don't want to be painting the rest of the
conveyor belt.<br><br>We say that the latest possible time to open the
valve and still accomplish the proper painting is the deadline. In this
case if we miss the deadline, we won't paint the part properly. Let's
say that our deadline is 1ms. That is the time from when the sensor
alerts us until the time we must have begun painting. To be sure that
we are never late, let's say we design our system to begin painting
950탎 after we receive the sensor interrupt. In some cases we may begin
painting a little before, and sometimes a little afterward.<br><br>Of
course, it will never be the case that we start painting exactly 950탎
after the interrupt, with infinite precision. For instance, we may be
early by 10탎 one time and late by 13탎 the next. This variance is
termed jitter. We can see from our example that if our system were to
provide large jitter, we would have to move our target time
significantly below 1ms to be assured of satisfying that deadline. This
also would mean that we frequently would be opening the valve much
sooner than actually required, which would waste paint. Thus, some
real-time systems will have requirements in terms of both deadlines and
jitter. We assume that our requirements say that any missed deadlines
are failures.<br><br>The term operating environment means the operating
system as well as the collection of processes running, the interrupt
activity and the activity of hardware devices (like disks). We want to
have an operating environment for our real-time application that is so
robust we are free to run any number of any kind of applications
concurrently with our real-time application and still have it perform
acceptably.<br><br>An operating environment where we can determine the
worst-case time for a given response time or requirement is
deterministic. Operating environments that don't allow us to determine
a worst-case time are called nondeterministic. Real-time applications
require a deterministic operating environment, and real-time operating
systems are capable of providing a deterministic operating environment.<br><br>Nondeterminism
is frequently caused by algorithms that do not run in constant time;
for example, if an operating system's scheduler must traverse its
entire run list to be able to decide which process to run next. This
algorithm is linear, sometimes notated as O(<i>n</i>), meaning read on the order of <i>n</i>. That is, as <i>n</i> (the number of processes on the run list) grows, the time to decide grows proportionally. With an O(<i>n</i>)
algorithm there is no upper bound on the time that the algorithm will
take. If your response time depends upon your sleeping process to be
awakened and selected to run, and the scheduler is O(<i>n</i>), then you will not be able to determine the worst-case time. This is a property of the Linux scheduler.<br><br>This
is important in an environment where the system designer cannot control
the number of processes that users of the system may create, this is
important. In an embedded system, where characteristics of the system,
such as the user interface, make it impossible for there to be any more
than a given number of processes, then the environment has been
constrained sufficiently to bound this kind of scheduling delay. This
is an example where determinism may be achievable by some aspect of the
configuration of the operating environment. Notice that a priority
system may be required, as well as other things, but as far as the
scheduling time is concerned, the time is bounded.<br><br>A visual
simulation may require an average target framerate, say 60 frames per
second. As long as frames are dropped relatively infrequently, and that
over a suitable period the framerate is 60 frames a second, the system
may be performing acceptably.<br><br>The example of the paint nozzle
and the average framerate are examples of what we call hard real-time
and soft real-time constraints, respectively. Hard real-time
applications must have their deadlines met, otherwise an unacceptable
result occurs. Something blows up, something crashes, some operation
fails, someone dies. Soft real-time applications usually must satisfy a
deadline, but if a certain number of deadlines are missed by just a
little bit, the system may still be considered to be operating
acceptably.<br><br>Let's consider another example. Imagine we are
building a penguin robot to aid scientists in studying animal behavior.
Through careful observation we determine that upon the emergence of a
seal from a hole in the ice, a penguin has 600ms to move away from the
hole to avoid being eaten by the seal. Will our robot penguin survive
if it moves back, on average, within 600ms? Perhaps, if the variance in
the attack time of the seal varies synchronously with our penguin's
response time. Are you going to build your penguin with that
assumption? We also realize that there is a certain distance from the
hole that the seal can reach. Our penguin must move farther than that
distance within the 600ms. Some would call that line the deadline.<br><br>For
an operating environment to accommodate a hard real-time application,
it must be able to insure that the application's deadlines always can
be satisfied. This implies that all actions within the operating system
must be deterministic. If the operating environment accommodates a soft
real-time application, this generally means that an occasional delay
may occur, but such a delay will not be unduly long.<br><br>Requirements
for an application may be quantitative or qualitative. A qualitative
requirement for a visual simulation would be that the system needs to
react quickly enough to seem natural. This reaction time would be
quantified to measure compliance. For example, a frame of graphics
based upon user input may have a requirement to be rendered within
33.3ms after the user's input. This means that if a pilot moves the
control stick in the flight simulator to bank right, the
out-of-the-window view should change to reflect the new flight path
within 33.3ms. Where did the 33.3ms requirement come from? Human
factors--that amount of time is fast enough so that humans perceive the
visual simulation as sufficiently smooth.<br><br>It is not the <i>value</i> of the time requirement but rather that there <i>is</i>
a time requirement that makes this a real-time requirement. If one
changed the requirement to have the graphics drawn within 33.3 seconds,
instead of 33.3ms, it would still be a real-time system. The difference
may be in the means to satisfy the requirements. In a Linux system the
33.3ms may require the use of a special Linux kernel and its functions,
whereas the 33.3 second requirement may be achievable by means
available within a standard kernel.<br><br>This leads us to a tenet:
fast does not imply real-time and vice versa. However, fast on a
relative scale may imply the need for real-time operating system
features. This leads us to the distinction between real-time operating
systems and real-time applications. Real-time applications have
time-related requirements. Real-time operating systems can guarantee
performance to real-time applications.<br><br>In practice, a
general-purpose operating system, such as Linux, provides sufficient
means for an application with relatively long deadlines if the
operating environment can be controlled suitably. It is because of this
property that one frequently hears that there is no need for real-time
operating systems because processors have become so fast. This is only
true for relatively uninteresting projects.<br><br>One has to remember,
though, that if the operating environment is not constrained suitably,
deadlines may be missed even though extensive testing never found a
case of a missed deadline. Linear-time algorithms, for example, may be
lurking in the code.<br><br>Another issue to keep in mind is audience
effect, often stated as "The more important the audience for one's
demo, the more likely the demo will fail." While anecdotal evidence
abounds for the audience effect, effects such as nonrepeatability are
often due to race conditions. A race condition is a situation where the
result depends upon the relative speeds of the tasks or the outside
world. All real-time systems, by definition, have race conditions.
Well-designed systems have race conditions only around required
deadlines. Testing alone cannot prove the lack of race conditions.<br><br>Since
an operating system is largely responsive instead of proactive, many
activities that cause delay can be avoided. In order for a particular
application (process) to be able to meet its deadlines, such things as
CPU-bound competitors, disk I/O, system calls or interrupts may need to
be controlled. These are the kinds of things that constitute a properly
constrained operating environment. Characteristics of the operating
system and drivers also may be of concern. The operating system may
block interrupts or not allow system calls to be preempted. While these
activities may be deterministic, they may cause delays that are longer
than acceptable for a given application.<br><br>A real-time operating system requires simpler efforts to constrain the environment than does a general-purpose operating system.<br><br><b>Is Linux Capable of Real Time?</b><br><br>Unless
we state otherwise, assume we are talking about the 2.4.9 version of
the Linux kernel. Version 2.4.9 was released in August 2001, although
our statements, at least for the most part, are true for the last
several years of kernel releases.<br><br>There are many qualities of an
operating system that may be necessary or desirable for it to be
appropriate for real-time applications. One list of features is
included in the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/realtime-computing/faq/" target="_blank"><u>FAQ at Comp.realtime</u></a>.
That list contains such features as the OS being multithreaded and
preemptible, and able to support thread priorities and provide
predictable thread-synchronization mechanisms. Linux is certainly
multithreaded, supports thread priorities and provides predictable
thread-synchronization mechanisms. The Linux kernel is not preemptible.<br><br>The
FAQ also says that one should know the OS behavior for interrupt
latency, time for system calls and maximum time that interrupts are
masked. Further, one should know the system-interrupt levels and
device-driver IRQ (interrupt request line) levels, as well as the
maximum time they take. We provide some timings for interrupt latency
and interrupt masked ("interrupts blocked") times in the benchmarking
section below.<br><br>Many developers also are interested in having a
deadline scheduler, a kernel that is preemptible in the millisecond
range or better, more than 100 priority levels, user-space support for
interrupt handlers and DMA, priority inheritance on synchronization
mechanisms, microsecond timer resolution, the complete set of POSIX
1003.1b functionality and constant time algorithms for scheduling,
exit(), etc. None of these capabilities are available in the standard
kernel and the GNU C library.<br><br>Additionally, in practice, the
magnitude of delays becomes important. The Linux kernel, in a
relatively easily constrained environment, may be capable of worst-case
response times of about 50ms, with the average being just a few
milliseconds.<br><br>Andrew Morton suggests that one should not scroll the framebuffer, run hdparm, use blkdev_close or switch consoles (see <a href="http://www.zip.com.au/%7Eakpm/linux/schedlat.html#ddt" target="_blank"><u>reference</u></a>). These are examples of constraining the operating environment.<br><br>Some
applications, however, may require response times on the order of 25탎.
Such requirements are not satisfiable in applications that are making
use of Linux kernel functionality. In such cases, some mechanism
outside of the Linux kernel functions must be employed in order to
assure such relatively short response-time deadlines.<br><br>We see, in
practice, that a hard real-time operating system can assure
deterministic response and provide response times that are
significantly faster than those provided by general-purpose operating
systems like Linux.<br><br>We see that Linux is not a real-time
operating system because it always cannot assure deterministic
performance and because its average and worst-case timing behavior is
far worse than that required by many real-time applications. Remember
that the timing behavior required by these many real-time applications
generally is not a hardware limitation. For example, the Linux kernel
response time may be on the order of a few milliseconds on a typical
x86-based PC, while the same hardware may be capable of better than
20탎 response times when running a real-time operating system.<br><br>The
two reasons that the Linux kernel has such relatively poor performance
on uniprocessor systems are because the kernel disables interrupts and
because the kernel is not suitably preemptible. If interrupts are
disabled, the system is not capable of responding to an incoming
interrupt. The longer that interrupts are delayed, the longer the
expected delay for an application's response to an interrupt. The lack
of kernel preemptibility means that the kernel does not preempt itself,
such as in a system call for a lower-priority process, in order to
switch to a higher-priority process that has just been awakened. This
may cause significant delay. On SMP systems, the Linux kernel also
employs locks and semaphores that will cause delays.<br><br><b>Real-Time Application Programming</b><br><br>User-space
real-time applications require services of the Linux kernel. Such
services, among other things, provide scheduling, interprocess
communication and performance improvement. Let's examine a variety of
system calls (the kernel's way of providing services to applications
that are of special benefit to real-time application developers). These
calls are used to constrain the operating environment.<br><br>There are
208 system calls in the Linux kernel. System calls usually are called
indirectly through library routines. The library routines usually have
the same name as the system call, and sometimes library routines map
into alternative system calls. For example, on Linux, the signal
library routine from the GNU C library, version 2.2.3, maps to the
sigaction system call.<br><br>A real-time application may call nearly
all of the set of system calls. The calls that are most interesting to
us are exit(2), fork(2), exec(2), kill(2), pipe(2), brk(2),
getrususage(2), mmap(2), setitimer(2), ipc(2) (in the form of semget(),
shmget() and msgget()), clone(), mlockall(2) and sched_setscheduler(2).
Most of these are described well in either <i>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</i>, by W. Richard Stevens, or in <i>POSIX.4: Programming for the Real World</i>,
by Bill O. Gallmeister. The clone() function is Linux-specific. The
others, for the most part, are compatible with typical UNIX systems.
However, read the man pages because there are some subtle differences
at times.<br><br>Real-time applications on Linux also frequently are
interested in the POSIX Threads calls, such as pthread_create() and
pthread_mutex_lock(). Several implementations of these functions exist
for Linux. The most commonly available of these is provided by the GNU
C library. These so-called LinuxThreads are based on the clone() system
call and are scheduled by the Linux scheduler. Some POSIX functions are
available for POSIX Threads (e.g., sem_wait()) but not for Linux
processes.<br><br>An application running on Linux ordinarily can be
slowed down considerably, from its best case, by a number of factors.
Essentially these are caused by contention for resources. Such
resources include synchronization primitives, main memory, the CPU, a
bus, the CPU cache and interrupt handling.<br><br>An application can
reduce its resource contention for these resources in a number of ways.
For synchronization mechanisms, e.g., mutexes and semaphores, an
application can reduce their use, employ priority inheritance versions,
employ relatively fast implementations, reduce the time in critical
sections, etc. Contention for the CPU is affected by priorities. In
this view, for example, lack of kernel preemption can be seen as a
priority inversion. Contention for a bus is probably not significantly
long to be of direct concern. However, know your hardware. Do you have
a clock that takes 70탎 to respond and holds the bus? Contention for a
cache is affected by frequent context switches and by large or random
data or instruction references.<br><br><b>What to Do?</b><br><br>Consequently,
real-time applications usually give themselves a high priority, lock
themselves in memory (and don't grow their memory usage), use lock-free
communication whenever possible, use cache memory wisely, avoid
nondeterministic I/O (e.g., sockets) and execute within a suitably
constrained system. Suitable constraints include limiting hardware
interrupts, limiting the number of processes, curtailing system call
use by other processes and avoiding kernel problem areas, e.g., don't
run hdparm.<br><br>Some of the system calls that should be made by a
real-time application require special privileges. This usually is
accomplished by having root be the owner of the process (having a shell
owned by root run the program or having the executable file have the
SUID bit set). A newer way is to make use of the capability mechanism.
There are capabilities for locking down memory, such as CAP_IPC_LOCK
(that "IPC" is in the name is just something we need to accept), and
for being able to set real-time priorities, which can be done with the
capability CAP_SYS_NICE.<br><br>A real-time process sets its priority
with sched_setscheduler(2). The current implementation provides the
standard POSIX policies of SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR, along with
priorities ranging in value from 1-99. Bigger is better. The POSIX
function to check the maximum allowable priority value for a given
policy is sched_get_priority_max(2).<br><br>A real-time process should
lock down its memory and not grow. Locking memory is done in Linux with
the POSIX standard function mlockall(2). Usually one uses the flags
value of MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE to lock down current memory and any
new memory if one's process grows in the future. While growing often is
not acceptable, if you get lucky and survive the delay you might as
well get the newly allocated memory locked down as well. Be careful to
grow your stack and allocate all dynamic memory, and then call
mlockall(2) before your process begins its time-critical phase. Note
that you can check to see if your process had any page faults during a
section of code by using getrusage(2). I show a code fragment below to
illustrate the use of several functions. Note that one should check the
return value from each of these calls and read the man pages for more
details:<br><br></font><pre><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3"><br> priority = sched_get_priority_max(SCHED_FIFO);<br> sp . sched_priority = priority;<br> sched_setscheduler(getpid(), SCHED_FIFO, &amp;sp);<br> mlockall(MCL_FUTURE | MCL_CURRENT);<br> getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF,&amp;ru_before);<br>     . . .  // R E A L   T I M E      S E C T I O N<br> getrusage(RUSAGE_SLEF,&amp;ru_after);<br> minorfaults = ru_after.ru_minflt - ru_before.ru_minflt;<br> majorfaults = ru_after.ru_majflt - ru_before.ru_majflt;<br></font></pre><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3"><br><b>Benchmarking for Real-Time Applications</b><br><br>There
are a number of efforts to benchmark various aspects of Linux.
Real-time application developers are most interested in interrupt
latency, timer granularity, context-switch time, system call overhead
and kernel preemptibility. Interrupt latency is the time from when a
device asserts an interrupt until the time that the appropriate
interrupt handler begins executing. This typically is delayed by the
handling of other interrupts and by interrupts being disabled. Linux
does not implement interrupt priorities. Most interrupts are blocked
when Linux is handling an interrupt. This time typically is quite
short, however, perhaps a few microseconds.<br><br>On the other hand, the kernel may block interrupts for a significantly longer time. The <a href="http://www.zip.com.au/%7Eakpm/linux/index.html#intlat" target="_blank"><u>intlat</u></a> program from Andrew Morton allows one to measure interrupt latencies. Similarly, his <a href="http://www.zip.com.au/%7Eakpm/linux/schedlat.html#schedlat" target="_blank"><u>schedlat</u></a> shows scheduling latencies.<br><br>Context-switch time is included in the well-known benchmark harness <a href="http://www.bitmover.com/lmbench/" target="_blank"><u>LMbench</u></a>, as well as by others (<a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/%7Ergooch/benchmarks/linux-scheduler.html" target="_blank"><u>reference 1</u></a>, <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Linux/Projects/Benchmarking/" target="_blank"><u>reference 2</u></a>). LMbench also provides information about system calls.<br><br>In
Table 1 we show the results of LMbench. This table shows context-switch
times. The benchmark program was run three times, and the lowest value
for the context-switch time for each configuration is reported in the
table as per the documentation for LMbench. The highest value, however,
was no more than about 10% larger than the minimum. The size of the
process is reported in kilobytes, the context-switch time is in
microseconds. The context-switch time data indicate that substantial
use of data in the cache causes significantly larger context-switch
times. The context-switch time includes time to restore the cache state.<br><br></font><center><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3"><a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/eljonline/issue07/5407t1.html" target="_blank"><b><u>Table 1. Context-Switch Times</u></b></a></font></center><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3"><br><br>As an example of interrupt-off times, one can see some results <a href="http://www.zip.com.au/%7Eakpm/linux/intlat/intlat-disk.html" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.
In one experiment with hdparm, the data show that interrupts can be
disabled for over 2ms while hdparm runs. Developers can use the intlat
mechanism to measure interrupt-off times for the system they are
running. It is only under rare conditions that interrupt-off times will
exceed 100탎. These conditions should be avoidable for most embedded
systems. They are the areas that Morton warns against.<br><br>An area
of more significant concern to most real-time developers is that of
scheduling latency. That is, the delay in continuing a newly awakened
high-priority task. A long delay is possible when the kernel is busy
executing a system call. This is because the Linux kernel will not
preempt a lower priority process in the midst of a system call in order
to execute a newly awakened higher priority process. This is why the
Linux kernel is termed non-preemptible.<br><br>The latency test from Benno Senoner shows that a delay of 100ms or more is possible (see <a href="http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/audio/" target="_blank"><u>reference</u></a>).
We can see that both interrupt blocking and scheduling latencies can be
sufficiently long to prevent satisfactory performance for some
applications.<br><br>Timing resolution is also of importance to many
embedded Linux developers. For example, the setitimer(2) function is
used to set a timer. This function, like other time functions in Linux,
has a resolution of 10ms. Thus, if one sets a timer to expire in 15ms,
it actually will expire in about 20ms. In a simple test measuring the
time interval between 1,000 successive 15ms timers, we found that the
average time interval was 19.99ms, the minimum time was 19.987ms and
the maximum time was 20.042ms on a quiescent system.<br><br></font><hr><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3"><br><img src="AT5997007602_files/5407aa.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5"><i><b>About the author:</b>
